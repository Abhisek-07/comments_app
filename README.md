# Comments App

A Flutter application that demonstrates the use of Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Remote Config. The app allows users to sign up and log in using email, stores user information in Firestore, and fetches comments from JSONPlaceholder. The app also uses Firebase Remote Config to determine whether to mask the email addresses in the comments based on a boolean flag.

## Features

- **Email Sign Up & Login**: Users can sign up and log in with email and password using Firebase Authentication.
- **Firestore Integration**: On sign-up, user data is stored in the Firestore users collection.
- **Remote Config**: The app fetches a boolean flag (`maskEmail`) from Firebase Remote Config to decide whether to mask the email address when displaying comments.
- **Comments Feed**: Fetches comments from JSONPlaceholder and displays them in the app. Email addresses are masked or unmasked based on the `maskEmail` flag.
- **State Management**: Uses Flutter Riverpod for managing the app's state and Flutter Hooks to simplify the UI logic.
